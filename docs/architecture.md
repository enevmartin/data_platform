# Data Platform Architecture

## Overview

The Data Platform is designed to collect, process, and analyze datasets from various institutional sources. It's built with flexibility and extensibility in mind, allowing for future integration of advanced features like data quality assessment, ML/AI pipelines, and automated data collection.

## System Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Django Core**
   - Provides data models and ORM for database interactions
   - Handles user authentication and authorization
   - Manages data persistence and validation

2. **FastAPI Layer**
   - Serves as the primary API interface
   - Provides high-performance endpoints
   - Handles file uploads and processing requests
   - Implements OpenAPI documentation

3. **File Processors**
   - Specialized handlers for different file formats (Excel, CSV, PDF, Parquet)
   - Extract data and metadata
   - Validate file structure and content

4. **Data Validators**
   - Assess data quality
   - Generate quality metrics
   - Determine suitability for different analytical tasks

5. **Storage Layer**
   - PostgreSQL database for structured data
   - File system storage for data files (configurable for cloud storage)

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Files are uploaded through the FastAPI endpoints
   - File format is detected and the appropriate handler is selected
   - Basic validation ensures file integrity

2. **Data Processing**
   - Files are parsed and metadata is extracted
   - Data is converted to a standardized format
   - Quality metrics are calculated

3. **Data Storage**
   - File metadata and institutional information stored in the database
   - Original files stored in a structured file system
   - Processed versions linked to originals

4. **Data Access**
   - RESTful API provides standardized access to all data
   - Filtering and search capabilities on datasets
   - File downloads with appropriate transformations

## Future Extensions

### Data Scrapers
- Automated collection of datasets from institutional websites
- Scheduled updates based on data frequency
- Authentication and session handling for secure sources

### Quality Assessment System
- Advanced statistical analysis of datasets
- Anomaly detection and validation
- Quality scoring for different use cases

### ML/DL Data Preparation
- Feature engineering pipelines
- Dataset normalization and transformation
- Training/test split generation

### AI Agent Integration
- Automated data analysis
- Insight generation
- Anomaly detection and alerting

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django + FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem (S3-compatible in production)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, PyPDF2, Parquet

## Deployment Architecture

In production, the system is designed to be deployed as containerized services:

1. **Web Service**: Django + FastAPI
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL
3. **Storage**: Object storage (S3-compatible)
4. **Load Balancer**: For distributing
